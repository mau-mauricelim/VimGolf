Trying to carefully make a ninja challenge.
This challenge is designed to show a particular vim feature (here I am stalling in order to doge a shorter counter-based solution, sorry for the headhache) this is the end of my line.
The question is, will a wiser vimgolf ninja defeat the purpose of this challenge ?
